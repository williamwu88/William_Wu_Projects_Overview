## 2018 Project

### Connect 4

**Project Period**: Mar 2018 - Apr 2018

**Repository**: [(To be uploaded)]

**Technology**: Java, Minimax Algorithm, tree pruning.

**Team work**:✗

**Description**: Implement the minimax search algorithm with and without alpha-beta pruning in order to play a game of Connect 4. Given an initial starting state of the board, and whose turn it is to play, will output the column to play in. The program also has a command line version where you can set up difficulty level and play with the computer.

### Pima-Classification

**Project Period**: Apr 2018 - Jun 2018

**Repository**: [(To be uploaded)]

**Technology**: Java, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree

**Team work**:✗

**Description**: Implement the Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms and evaluate them on a real dataset using the stratified cross validation method. Classify patient as diabetes or not by training model using Naive bayes and decision tree.

### Virtual Stack

**Project Period**: Mar 2018 - Apr 2018

**Repository**: Unavailable

**Technology**: C, Bash script

**Team work**:✗

**Description**: Implement a virtual stack using C, and perform operations on a virtual stack. The program will take a single command line argument being the name of the file containing the pseudo-assembly code. It will read the pseudo-assembly code, perform commands, and return the expected results after these operations.

### Supergraph

**Project Period**: Apr 2018 - Jun 2018

**Repository**: Unavailable

**Technology**: C, multi-threading

**Team work**:✗

**Description**: Write program using the C programming language that will handle different queries from the given social media data and compute the correct result. Functions include: Given a post id, find all reposts of the given post; Given a post id, your query will need to initially determine if the post is an original or a repost; Find the shortest path between two users; Find all the robot accounts.

## 2017 Project

### Pipez

**Project Period**: Apr 2017 - Jun 2017

**Repository**: [(Open Source)](https://github.com/williamwu88/pipez_ENGG1805)

**Technology**: Java, JUnit

**Team work**:✓

**Description**: Pipez is a simple system for executing workflows that do text transformations. A workflow is defined as a pipeline of one or more pipes, each of which performs a specific transformation. The system currently supports CSV document transformations.

### Arithmetic LinkedBinaryTree

**Project Period**: Aug 2017 - Nov 2017

**Repository**: [(To be uploaded)]

**Technology**: Java, Data structures: Binary tree, hashMap

**Team work**:✗

**Description**: Render linked binary arithmetic tree to simplify arithmetic expression represented in prefix notation (also known as Polish notation). Method includes: Check if a tree represents a valid arithmetic expression. Convert a prefix notation arithmetic expression to a binary tree; Produce arithmetic expression in prefix, infix notation; Subsitute a numeric value for a variable in all of it’s instances in a tree.


## 2016 Project

### NoStroke.com

**Project Period**: Aug 2016 - Nov 2016

**Repository**: [(Open Source)](https://github.com/williamwu88/NoStroke_INFO1003)

**Technology**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap

**Team work**:✓

**Description**: NoStroke is an interactive content providing website with quality information so that the public understands about IM and stroke, available IM treatments for stroke patients, scientific evidence of these IM approaches for stroke treatment. The website also has a tool to help users understand their likelihood of having a stroke.
