## 2018 Projects

### Virtual Stack(Mar 2018 - Apr 2018)
[Repository(Unavailable)]

Technology used: C, Bash script

Team work:✗

Implement a virtual stack using C, and perform operations on a virtual stack. The program will take a single command line argument being the name of the file containing the pseudo-assembly code. It will read the pseudo-assembly code, perform commands, and return the expected results after these operations.

### Supergraph(Apr 2018 - Jun 2018)
[Repository(Unavailable)]

Technology used: C, multi-threading

Team work:✗

Write program using the C programming language that will handle different queries from the given social media data and compute the correct result. Functions include: Given a post id, find all reposts of the given post; Given a post id, your query will need to initially determine if the post is an original or a repost; Find the shortest path between two users; Find all the robot accounts.

### Connect 4(Mar 2018 - Apr 2018)
[Repository(To be uploaded)]

Technology used: Java, Minimax Algorithm, tree pruning.

Team work:✗

Implement the minimax search algorithm with and without alpha-beta pruning in order to play a game of Connect 4. Given an initial starting state of the board, and whose turn it is to play, will output the column to play in. The program also has a command line version where you can set up difficulty level and play with the computer.

### Pima-Classification(Apr 2018 - Jun 2018)
[Repository(To be uploaded)]

### LinkedBinaryTree(Aug 2017 - Nov 2017)
[Repository(To be uploaded)]

Technology used: Java, Data structures: Binary tree, hashMap

Team work:✗

Render linked binary arithmetic tree to simplify arithmetic expression represented in prefix notation (also known as Polish notation). Method includes: Check if a tree represents a valid arithmetic expression. Convert a prefix notation arithmetic expression to a binary tree; Produce arithmetic expression in prefix, infix notation; Subsitute a numeric value for a variable in all of it’s instances in a tree.
